/**
 * @deprecated This test file has been deprecated and should be removed.
 *
 * Reason: This test was too fragile and dependent on hardcoded line numbers.
 * Every change to main.ts would break these tests, requiring constant maintenance.
 * The cost-benefit ratio was poor, as the tests were verifying implementation
 * details rather than actual behavior.
 *
 * The functionality these tests were verifying:
 * - highlightCandidateHintsAsync is called without await
 * - Proper comments exist
 * - Function is exported
 *
 * These aspects are either:
 * 1. Covered by other integration tests
 * 2. Not critical enough to warrant such fragile tests
 * 3. Better verified through code review than automated tests
 *
 * Date deprecated: 2024-09-26
 * Process3 Sub1 - main.ts refactoring
